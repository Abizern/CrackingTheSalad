# Frequency Distribution Graph
 
 You can visualise the data but you will also need a human (ðŸ¤–)
 
 Check the frequency distribution of a normal English sentence and then compare the graph to the cipher.
 Which letters occur the most and which the least? Count the offset of the highest to get your Caesar cipher offset number.

 ## Visualise the data

 How to prepare data set for the Graph class?
 
 Feed it with an array of tuples `(key: String, value: Int)` and call `draw()` method to get an `UIImage`.
 
 [Tip: Click on the square on the right hand side to see the graph]
 
 Example:
 ````
 let dataset = [(key: "a", value: 10), (key: "b", value: 2), (key: "c", value: 20)]
 Graph(dataSet: dataset).draw()
 ````
